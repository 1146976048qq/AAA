Batman - The Movie Review. But this for my kids and it was the most boring movie I have ever watched.The shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie 
Case Study of County Politics. This film tells a story about LaSalle Parish in Louisiana and by extension the rest of America . Sheriff Darryl is shown handling the rigors 
no teeth to this one. Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn t think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I 
Direct to video potboiler re-tread that never should have been made. This direct to video sequel is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller 
Cant watch. I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion. This is the first of two downloads that didn t play. I 
Avoid this bootleg. This DVD is a poor quality bootleg. The real U.S. title of this film is Master Killer , but the original title is 36th Chamber of Shaolin 
BO-ring!!!!. Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, Bo and John Derek managed to massacre the Tarzan legend while wreaking cinematic havoc with this unbelievably bad waste of celluloid. 
GARBAGE. This movie was really a waste of money. the writing the directin are all very bad. it is also very low budget which i thought would increase the realness 
Not happy. This is only a portion of this episode. It cuts off in the middle of a sentence  
Do the right thing...avoid this movie. I would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided. 
What about the missing episodes. Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe 
Missing episodes. This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series

The end of a great show begins. THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980 s. It pains me to say this for I am a

For Joe Dallesandro fans only. If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on

Painful. From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script--

Mixed feelings. I have very mixed feeling about this tape. When I bought it, I did not realize it was for new mothers. I have Cindy s two previous workouts 
NL BOMB !!!!!. I just purchased this film and viewed it. It is the BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buyer beware !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I Love National Lampoon, but this was not a hit. 
Jet, what were you doing in this?. Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn t that famous is because it pretty much sucks. 
A Waste of Time. I think this is the same version of Animal Farm I saw that completely changed the ending of the book. This version actually makes a happy

&quot;Is theah a convick in that theah closet?&quot;. Strange stuff--Duvall rants, gibbers, and fires a shotgun into an empty closet. Haas watches, listens, and smiles a lot. The great James 
so-so. I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew 
An Abomination!!. I am a big fan of this franchise however, I refuse to include this in the series! They should ve put the title National Lampoon s before this.. 
AMAZON SUCKS. I live in the UK and Amazon doesn t allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!  
THE THIEF OF BAGDAD. This was awful. I m sorry I spent a penny on this.  
Good God. This movie is Bloodsport minus the entertaining parts. Better production value- much worse script. Much worse everything almost. So if you liked Bloodsport which even at its cheesiest 
Extremely Annoying. If you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts, but for those of you who prefer a plot and 
Disgusting and pointless. Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa? I am 
Disappointed. I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie. My husband and 
UNWATCHABLE !. Save your money. I gave up halfway through and shredded the DVD. Amanda Peet was great in Saving Silverman , but she should be mortified by this movie. 
Is cringe-worthy a word?. I m surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn t much here I liked. The soundtrack was 
Poor support. This was my first download of this type and also my last. I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it 
Why the Charge. Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website. Yeah, at the CBS site you 
This is Horrible. I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I ve been trying for the 
Water-logged. Whew! After reading other reviewer s remarks, I m glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap. The cinematography is great, and 
Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors. I purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed. I have nothing more to add to the other reviews 
Boring to watch. The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to 
Nothing like the book. Although this movie is based loosely on the book, the hour and a half it runs for gives no time to explore all of the nuances 
UnBox video not yet working. Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message: can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273 I made the 
I won t buy it... Someone just today told me I should see this film.What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber.Oh

Irritating and unorigional. I don t remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar. If I have seen her elsewhere, it must 
BORING, TACKY. Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the 
Warning Incomplete Episode!!!. The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly 
KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!. KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL, ALL, ALL, TIME SINCE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEFORE THAT! IN THEATERS I WAS THE ONLY 
Dreary, hard to watch. Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale. Began to watch 
Star Trek: City on the Edge of Forever. My favorite show of the Trek series but there s no way I d buy another individual program from Amazon. It will 
Brings back memories but ultimately it disappoints..... Yep, like many viewers I watched this when I was too young and was scared for like weeks on end and couldnt get 
AMAZON SUCKS. I live in the UK and Amazon doesn t allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!  
What s up with that?. I wish I had read the other reviews first. Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off 
If you re looking for a fairy tale, this is the movie for you. Aside from some of the special effects, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.The 
I ve been cheated by Amazon. It really sucks, tried to download but it s not able to be viewed in pc s outsided the united states. Crikey.I ll have 
Worst acting ever!. I turned this movie on one morning and was glued to it for 30 mins because I just knew it was a joke! WHM spoke as if 
Dont get Fiji final week ... Dont dwnld Survivor, Thunderstorms & Sacrifice . Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would 
Warning, Waste of Money. I m trying to figure out what movie these other reviewers were watching. I wasted my money so you won t waste yours. It was so 
kultur shock. This is a total DVD disaster fom Kultur. I have tried two copies of this wonderful performance and both had a miserable soundtrack and opera is sound. Volume 
Really, really bad movie... one of the worst movies i ve seen. Man, there s no way to describe this movie.Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting...Really low-budget in 
1.75 STARS: It s hard to give this movie any credit. After watching Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper , I came away with mixed feelings. On the one hand, Anthropohagus had 
Cruel Brittania. Britain, circa 1997. Tony Blair is elected P.M. Princess Di perishes. And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public. This effort is an attempt to cash 
Wayne and Hepburn Take African Queen Route. The unique screen chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of The African Queen. Without Wayne and Hepburn, 
Far and Away. Very disappointed because I can t watch it on my DVD player. I would have asked for a refund and returned it but don t know how 
Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem like Shakespeare. What a great cast! I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right? After it 
Great Movie - HORRIBLE DVD. The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen. There are 
Rent it, don t buy it, and then fast forward. I consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique, or even delayed plot structure, except here. I must admit, 
Silly claptrap. Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man 
Like, Almost Totally Gross!. Although Valley Girl came out when I was a teenager, it somehow eluded me until now. I bought it because of the favorable reviews, and of 
Assistant Night Manager of Illusions, maybe. It s always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she s either a very smart X-Person or 
Pipi Longstocking. Pipi LongstockingPippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are 
A BIG BOMB AND A STINKER FOR TOM CRUISE!. This movie is nearly 3 hours of hot air as bad as the movie The Hindenburg! If George C Scott saw 
more like 2 and a half stars. Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical 
What a let down disappointment this film was!. Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others!The acting 
Not Happy. I m a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd s area released months behind those in the USA. Why is this 
A rather boring movie adaptation despite Vincent Price s brilliance. I simply thought that The Fall of the House of Usher was rather boring and I found myself dozing off. 
WHAT???????. This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good. But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing 
NO STARS movie!. A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota 
Ambrose Bierce is a Better Authority. I have rented this video for the sake of a trip down Memory Lane. Of course, fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility. 
Sub-par issue of Excellent series. The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman s Scenes from a Marriage 
Star Trek: City on the Edge of Forever. My favorite show of the Trek series but there s no way I d buy another individual program from Amazon. It will

NO JET LI DIDN T!. I love Jet Li, I collect all his dvds but this movie really [stank]! Don t buy it even for the collection! Nobody will notice 
Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people. Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive 
I will never watch this again.... As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it. I found myself thinking throughout the movie I 
Beware of Unbox!!!. Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec. Well, they charged me for

read the book instead. This movie, the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it, is only worth watching to 
DVD PUT IT ON DVD. I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE  
Cheesy Sci-Fi flick only has some good things to offer, but its really silly... Josh Charles S.W.A.T., Tv s Sports Night finds out that he is the bearer of a

0 STARS: This movie sucks. Sometimes They Come Back is a terrible attempt at a horror movie. I love Tim Matheson and I think he is a very good actor, 
Survivor Rip Off. I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season 
I can t believe people enjoy this movie. This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do 
Just another boring 70s movie. First off, the name of the movie and the cover art are completely misleading - this has nothing to do with any sort of Graveyard 
Dont get Fiji final week ... Dont dwnld Survivor, Thunderstorms & Sacrifice . Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would
